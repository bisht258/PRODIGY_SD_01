# PRODIGY_SD_01
This Java program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users input a temperature value and its unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and the program outputs the equivalent temperatures in the other two units. Developed during my ProDigy Infotech internship, it showcases practical Java application skills.
