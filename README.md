Temperature Conversion Program
Overview
This repository contains a Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Developed during my internship at ProDigy Infotech, this project showcases a simple yet practical application of Java for solving everyday problems.

Features
User Input: Prompts the user to enter a temperature value and its unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
Conversion: Converts the input temperature to the other two units.
Output: Displays the converted temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Example
If a user inputs 25°C, the program will output:

77.0 °F
298.15 K
